        <p>The United Kingdom is a highly developed nation that exerts considerable international economic, political, scientific and cultural influence.</p>
        <p>The UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the Pax Britannica between 1815 and 1914. The British Empire was the leading economic power for most of the 19th century, a position supported by its agricultural prosperity, its role as a dominant trading nation, a massive industrial capacity, significant technological achievements, and the rise of 19th-century London as the world's principal financial centre. At its height in the 1920s, the British Empire encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the largest empire in history. However, its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power and a global wave of decolonisation led to the independence of most British colonies.</p>
        <p>A developed country with an advanced economy, the UK ranks amongst the largest economies by nominal GDP, and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. It is a nuclear state with one of the world's highest military budgets. Its soft power influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies, and British culture remains globally influential, particularly in language, literature, music and sport. English is the world's most widely spoken language and the third-most spoken native language. The country is part of multiple international organisations and forums.</p>
